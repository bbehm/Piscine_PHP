## Day03 - Network and System Administration with PHP

For this day's exercises I had to install [__bitnami MAMP__](https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp). The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.bitnami.com/installer/infrastructure/mamp/get-started/get-started/). We only install phpMyAdmin.

Bitnami MAMP provides a complete PHP, MySQL and Apache development environment.

## curl for cookies

[curl](https://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/ssen/src/curl-7.11.1/docs/curl.html) is a tool to transfer data from or to a server using one of the supported protocols.

Curl flags:
- `-b`: __cookie__, pass the data to the http server as a cookie.
- `-c`: __cookie-jar__, to specify wo which file you want your curl to write all cookies
