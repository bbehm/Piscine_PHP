# Introduction to PHP

[PHP Basics](https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp)

### Echo and Print

Basically the same. `echo` has no return value while `print`has a return value of 1. `echo`can take multiple parameters while `print` can take one argument. `echo` is slightly faster.

### == and ===

'==' means equal and '===' means identical. '==' should be used to check if values of two operands are equal while '===' checks the values as well as type of operands.

### Some useful built in functions

- __strpbrk()__: searching a string for characters 
- ...

### New syntax (for me)

- [Switch statements](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_switch.asp)
- [Arrow functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arrow.php) in PHP
