<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector Class handles vectors in a three dimensional space. It constructs
a vector from two vertices:

		($array['dest']) which is mandatory
		($array['orig']) which defaults to (0,0,0,1) when not given

new Vector( array( 'orig' => $vtxO, 'dest' => $vtxX ) );

The class has the following methods:

float magnitude();
Returns the length of the vector

Vector normalize();
Returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is already normalized
it returns a fresh copy of the vector.

Vector add( Vector $rhs );
Returns the sum of both vectors.

Vector sub( Vector $rhs );
Returns the difference vector of both vectors.

Vector opposite();
Returns the opposite vector.

Vector scalarProduct( $k );
Returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors.

float dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar.

float cos( Vector $rhs );
Returns the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs);
Returns the cross multiplication of both vectors (right-hand system).
